# News Site

I choose a site about sailboats and the offshore race gotland runt.
It was a fun project but i got overwelmed with information a few times and got stuck.
I struggled a lot with flexbox and then used grid instead wich I found was way easier to understand.

## The problem

I forced myself to teak a break, and move or eat something and solved almost every problem myself. I used slack at one time to ask for help and got the help i needed very fast.

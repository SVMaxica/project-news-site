I choose a site about sailboats and the offshore race gotland runt.
It was a fun project but i got overwelmed with information a few times and got stuck.

I forced myself to teak a break, and move or eat something and solved almost every problem myself. I used slack at one time to ask for help and got the help i needed very fast.

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
